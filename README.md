# 17735-project

You'll need to download the dataset https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/dataset/Insider_Threat_Test_Dataset/12841247?file=24857825 

Assumptions:
- data structure and file structure follows that of the dataset linked above
- the first entry of the device, http, and logon files are on the same date

This is really ugly code, I will refactor it and fix a few bugs with skipping over some data during extraction later. Also this is really inefficient at the moment, will take a few minutes to run.
